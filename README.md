# Practice
Repo holds practice notebooks. These notebooks are for new and old skills I have learned.
## Notebooks
1. Notes-Practice
 >- This is the first notebook I used for practice.
 >- It is filled with notes I took practicing Python fundamentals as well as during my finance class on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-finance-investment-fundamentals-data-analytics/).

There are multiple notebooks that practice different skills.
- Some of the notebooks cross-over in terms of skills but works towards different things.

The point of this repository isn't for anything other than to record what I have done and where I have come from.
