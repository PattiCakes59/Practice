# Practice
Repo holds practice notebooks. These notebooks are for new and old skills I have learned.
## Notebooks
1. Notes-Practice
 >- There are several different notebooks and files:
 1. Teaching myself C# based off of the Microsoft tutorial site and other relevant info.
 2. Learning about python with finance from a class in Udemy.
 3. Brushing up on my python skills overall from a bootcamp on Udemy.
 4. Taking notes in a word document about SQL.
 5. There is a random notebook where I practice functions.

Within some of these notebooks skills will overlap. This is good because it allows me to ingrain these skills at a deeper level.
I hope to move onto machine learning to create some projects. They might not end up in this repository but there will be links here to direct the reader to them.

The point of this repository isn't for anything other than to record what I have done and where I have come from.
